KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS

1)KPI Cards: 
Key Finding: The current churn rate of 26.5% indicates a high customer turnover that significantly offsets new acquisition efforts.
Recommendation: Reducing this by 5% or so would highly improve the long-term Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and profitability.

2) Churn by Contract Type (Donut chart)
Key Finding: Month-to-month contracts are the primary source of churn, whereas multi-year contracts show exceptionally high retention.
Recommendation: Incentivize the "Contract Bridge" by offering a small discount for users to migrate from monthly to annual billing.

3) Churn Rate by Tenure Group (Clustered Column chart)
Key Finding: The highest churn occurs within the first 12 months, making it the "critical window" for customer success.
Recommendation: Implement a robust 90-day onboarding program to ensure new users find value early and survive the high-risk first year.

4) Service Stickiness heatmap (Matrix visual)
Insight: Fiber Optic users on month-to-month plans represent our highest revenue risk cohort.
Recommendation: Plan prioritized proactive outreach and loyalty offers specifically for this high-value, high-risk segment.

5) Service Influence (Stacked Bar chart)
Key Finding: Customers using Fiber Optic internet who do not have Online Security represent the highest churn volume in the entire dataset.
Recommendation: Launch a "Security First" campaign targeting Fiber Optic users; offering a discounted bundle for security services can act as a "lock-in" mechanism to improve retention in this particularly premium segment.

6) Customer Table (Detailed data view)
Key Finding: This table allows for granular identification of high-value "at-risk" customers (those with high Monthly Charges and Month-to-month contracts) before they churn.
Advise: Use this list to feed a "High-Touch" customer success workflow where account managers reach out personally to the top 50 highest-paying monthly customers to offer loyalty incentives.

7) Payment Friction analysis (Clustered Bar chart)
Key Finding: We are losing significant annual revenue specifically from customers using "Electronic Check" payments. Paperless billing combined with automated payments creates the most "frictionless" and loyal customer experience.
Recommendation: Mitigate "passive churn" by transitioning customers to automated Credit Card or Bank Transfer payments. Phase out manual paper billing to reduce the monthly "re-decision" point that leads to churn.

8) Product Density (Line and Stacked Column chart)
Insight: Churn rate drops exponentially as customers adopt three or more services.
Strategic Move: Focus marketing efforts on "cross-selling" existing customers rather than just acquiring new single-service users.

9) Price Sensitivity (Area Chart)
Insight: A "Price Wall" exists at the $70–$80 mark where churn peaks regardless of the service quality.
Recommendation: Re-evaluate our mid-tier pricing to ensure we aren't pushing customers toward competitors when their bill hits this threshold.
